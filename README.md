## How I Built the Website

### 1. **HTML Structure**
I started by analyzing the provided design and breaking it down into semantic HTML elements. Hereâ€™s how I structured the HTML:

- **Header Section**: Contains the navigation bar and hero section.
- **Main Content**: Includes sections for features, testimonials, and calls to action.
- **Footer**: Contains links, social media icons, and copyright information.

I used semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to ensure the website is accessible and well-structured.

### 2. **CSS Styling**
To replicate the design, I used CSS for styling and layout. Here are the key CSS concepts I applied:

- **Flexbox**: Used for creating flexible and responsive layouts, especially for the navigation bar and feature sections.
- **Grid**: Implemented CSS Grid for more complex layouts, such as the testimonial section.
- **Media Queries**: Added responsive design by using media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
- **Custom Fonts**: Integrated custom fonts using `@font-face` and Google Fonts.
- **Box Model**: Utilized padding, margin, and border properties to space elements correctly.
- **Transitions and Hover Effects**: Added subtle hover effects to buttons and links for better user interaction.

### 3. **Images and Icons**
I included images and icons to match the design. These were placed in the `./images/` folder and linked in the HTML and CSS files.

### 4. **Responsive Design**
The website is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. I used media queries to adjust the layout, font sizes, and image dimensions for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

## Core Concepts Applied

This project helped me practice and apply the following core concepts of HTML and CSS:

### HTML:
- Semantic HTML tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.)
- Image embedding (`<img>`)
- Links and navigation (`<a>`, `<nav>`)
- Lists (`<ul>`, `<li>`)
- Forms and buttons (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<button>`)

### CSS:
- Box model (margin, padding, border)
- Flexbox and Grid for layout
- Media queries for responsiveness
- Custom fonts and typography
- Pseudo-classes (`:hover`, `:focus`)
- Transitions and animations
