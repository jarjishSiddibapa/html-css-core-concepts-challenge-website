HTML & CSS Core Concepts Challenge Website
Welcome to my first challenge website project! This project is part of the 100 Days of Web Development course by Academind. On Day 9, I took on the challenge of replicating a website design using only HTML and CSS. This project helped me solidify my understanding of core web development concepts and gave me hands-on experience in building a responsive and visually appealing website.

Project Overview
The goal of this project was to recreate a website design provided as an image (./images/expected-website.png). I built the website from scratch using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. The final output of my website is saved as ./images/my-website-final-output.png for comparison.

Key Features:
Responsive Design: The website is designed to be responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

Semantic HTML: Proper use of semantic HTML elements for better accessibility and SEO.

CSS Styling: Utilized CSS properties like Flexbox, Grid, and media queries to achieve the desired layout and design.

Image Integration: Added images and icons to match the design.

Typography: Custom fonts and text styling to replicate the design accurately.

â””â”€â”€ README.md                      # This file
How I Built the Website
1. HTML Structure
I started by analyzing the provided design and breaking it down into semantic HTML elements. Hereâ€™s how I structured the HTML:

Header Section: Contains the navigation bar and hero section.

Main Content: Includes sections for features, testimonials, and calls to action.

Footer: Contains links, social media icons, and copyright information.

I used semantic tags like <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> to ensure the website is accessible and well-structured.

2. CSS Styling
To replicate the design, I used CSS for styling and layout. Here are the key CSS concepts I applied:

Flexbox: Used for creating flexible and responsive layouts, especially for the navigation bar and feature sections.

Grid: Implemented CSS Grid for more complex layouts, such as the testimonial section.

Media Queries: Added responsive design by using media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.

Custom Fonts: Integrated custom fonts using @font-face and Google Fonts.

Box Model: Utilized padding, margin, and border properties to space elements correctly.

Transitions and Hover Effects: Added subtle hover effects to buttons and links for better user interaction.

3. Images and Icons
I included images and icons to match the design. These were placed in the ./images/ folder and linked in the HTML and CSS files.

4. Responsive Design
The website is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. I used media queries to adjust the layout, font sizes, and image dimensions for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

Core Concepts Applied
This project helped me practice and apply the following core concepts of HTML and CSS:

HTML:
Semantic HTML tags (<header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>, etc.)

Image embedding (<img>)

Links and navigation (<a>, <nav>)

Lists (<ul>, <li>)

Forms and buttons (<form>, <input>, <button>)

CSS:
Box model (margin, padding, border)

Flexbox and Grid for layout

Media queries for responsiveness

Custom fonts and typography

Pseudo-classes (:hover, :focus)

Transitions and animations

Final Output
Hereâ€™s a comparison of the original design and my final output:

What I Learned
This project was a great learning experience. Here are some key takeaways:

The importance of semantic HTML for accessibility and SEO.

How to use Flexbox and Grid to create complex layouts.

The role of media queries in building responsive designs.

The value of breaking down a design into smaller components before coding.

Future Improvements
While Iâ€™m happy with the outcome, thereâ€™s always room for improvement. Some ideas for future enhancements include:

Adding more interactivity with JavaScript.

Optimizing the website for performance.

Improving accessibility with ARIA roles and labels.
