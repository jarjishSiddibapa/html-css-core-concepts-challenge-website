# HTML & CSS Core Concepts Challenge Website

This repository contains the code for the first challenge I completed as part of the 100 Days of Web Development by Academind. The challenge was to replicate a given website image using core HTML and CSS concepts. The challenge helped me practice my understanding of these fundamental web development tools.

## Challenge Overview

As part of Day 9 of the 100 Days of Web Development, I was tasked with replicating a given website design. The reference image for the website design is stored in this repository under `./images/expected-website.png`, and the final output of my website is saved under `./images/my-website-final-output.png`.

The goal of this challenge was to strengthen my skills in basic HTML and CSS, focusing on:

- Layout structure
- Styling using CSS properties
- Use of images and text
- Responsive design techniques

## Features of the Website

- **Layout and Structure**: 
  The layout was built using HTML to structure the content of the page. I used semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<article>` to ensure the content was well-organized and accessible. The website consists of a header with navigation links, a main content area with multiple sections, and a footer.

- **Styling with CSS**: 
  All visual styling was done using CSS. I used properties like `background-color`, `font-size`, `text-align`, `margin`, `padding`, and `border` to style the page elements. I also utilized `flexbox` for creating a flexible and responsive layout, making sure the website looks good on both small and large screens.

- **Responsive Design**: 
  To ensure the website is mobile-friendly, I used media queries to adjust the layout for smaller screen sizes. The navigation menu becomes a hamburger-style menu on mobile devices, and the text and images resize based on the available screen width.

- **Typography**: 
  I used Google Fonts to enhance the typography and give the website a modern look. This included selecting fonts that were legible and aesthetically pleasing.

- **Images**: 
  Images were used both for decoration and to enhance the visual appeal of the website. I optimized the image file sizes to ensure faster loading times.
